        <p>In the previous CSS example, p is called a selector — it selects the element(s) to style. In particular, p selects all the paragraphs in the HTML. The line inside the curly braces ({ }) is called a declaration – it sets a value for a specific property. In this case, the property is color, which controls the text color of the paragraphs, and the property value set is red.</p>
        <p>In this CSS rule, we've included an element (or type) selector, which selects a specific HTML element. We've also included two other selector types, which aren't relevant to the rest of this tutorial. If you're curious about what they do, check out our <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Basic_selectors"> Basic selectors</a> guide.</p>
